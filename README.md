# AI-Driven Stock Selection System
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A sophisticated stock recommendation system that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze Reddit posts and news articles, performing sentiment analysis to provide data-driven investment insights.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Source Data Scraping**: Automatically scrapes relevant financial discussions from Reddit and news articles
- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: Uses natural language processing to analyze market sentiment
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Generates stock recommendations based on sentiment trends and market analysis
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuously monitors and processes new content for up-to-date insights
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential risks associated with each stock recommendation
- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Tracks the accuracy of past recommendations

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The system scrapes financial subreddits (r/stocks, r/investing, r/wallstreetbets) and major financial news sources
2. **Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses text data, removing noise and irrelevant information
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies machine learning models to determine sentiment polarity and intensity
4. **Stock Correlation**: Maps sentiment data to specific stocks and companies
5. **AI Analysis**: Uses trained models to generate buy/sell/hold recommendations
6. **Risk Evaluation**: Assesses potential risks and provides confidence scores

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- API keys for Reddit and news sources

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-stock-picker.git
cd ai-stock-picker
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
python setup_db.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_app_name
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
SENTIMENT_MODEL_PATH=models/sentiment_model.pkl
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the complete analysis pipeline
python main.py

# Run only the scraping component
python scraper.py --source reddit --subreddit stocks

# Run sentiment analysis on existing data
python sentiment_analyzer.py --input data/scraped_posts.json

# Generate recommendations
python recommender.py --output recommendations.json
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from stock_picker import StockRecommendationSystem

# Initialize the system
system = StockRecommendationSystem()

# Get recommendations for specific stocks
recommendations = system.get_recommendations(['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL'])

# Get top trending stocks
trending = system.get_trending_stocks(limit=10)

# Analyze sentiment for a specific stock
sentiment = system.analyze_stock_sentiment('AAPL', days=7)
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The system tracks various performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct buy/sell/hold predictions
- **Precision**: True positive rate for recommendations
- **Recall**: Coverage of profitable opportunities
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measurement
